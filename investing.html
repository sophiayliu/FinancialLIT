  <p class = "question" > <b>What is a market index?</b></p>
  <p>A market index is a group of stocks that are bought and sold as one unit. Some notable market indexes include the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500. </p>

  <p class = "question"> <b>What is the stock market?</b></p>
  <p>Stock market is the umbrella term for the aggregate of buyers and sellers of stocks. Stocks are traded in <b>stock exchanges</b>, such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Each exchange offers specific stocks or market indexes to be bought and sold. </p>

  <p class = "question"> <b>How do people make money from stocks?</b></p>
  <p><b>Buy low and sell high:</b> The classic strategy for making a profit from stocks, buying low and selling high simply means selling your stock for a higher price than you purchased it for.</p>
  <p><b>Short-selling:</b> Short-selling is the reverse of buying low and selling high. Short-selling involves borrowing shares of stock (usually from a broker), selling them on the open market, and then buying them back – when and if the market prices drop. Essentially, you sell first, then buy. Short-selling relies on the stock’s price declining in order for you to make a profit.</p>
  <p><b>Collecting dividends:</b> Many stocks pay dividends, which is a portion of the company’s profits paid to stockholders. The amount of a dividend usually is determined by the company's profits per share. Typically issued each quarter, dividends are usually paid in cash but sometimes in additional shares of stock.</p>
    
  <p class = "question"><b>Why invest in stocks?</b></p>
  <p> On one hand, stocks can be a profitable investment strategy. Average stock returns are about 10% a year, which is about 10x higher than the average savings account. However, it is critical to also keep in mind that the market changes every year – sometimes returns can be as high as 30% and other times, lower than 10%. It is even possible to lose all the money you used to purchase shares if the company goes bankrupt and the share price goes to zero. You can win big, but you can also lose big. </p>
