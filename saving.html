  <p class = "question" > <b>What is an emergency saving?</b></p>
  <p>An emergency fund/saving is a sum of money that is set aside in case of unexpected expenses. </p>

  <p class = "question"><b>Benefits of Having an Emergency Saving:</b><p>

1) Lower stress levels : Knowing that you have an emergency fund to back you up in case of an emergency can significantly lower stress levels. 
<p>2) Encourages good financial habits : Being aware of your financial goals and plans will definitely help in preventing unwise purchases</p>


<p class = "question"><b>Tips for an Efficient Emergency Fund:</b></p>

<p>1) Automate your savings - Set up a separate account for your emergency fund and have your employer directly deposit a certain amount of your pay into it. If you can’t see the money, you won’t be able to use it!
<p>2) Lower your monthly spendings - Spending money wisely will leave you with more savings and funds for your emergency account. </p>
<p>3) Set reasonable goals - Have an overall goal for your emergency fund and set smaller goals to slowly work towards it. Emergency funds are NOT the same as savings; a small sum of money is taken from your savings in order to create your emergency funds. Therefore, you shouldn’t devote too much of your savings into your emergency fund!</p>

<p class = "question"><b> What is a student loan?</b></p>
<p>A specific kind of loan intended to assist students in covering the costs of post-secondary education and related fees</p>

<p class = "question"><b>Different options for federal student loans</b>

<p>Direct subsidized loans - loans that are available to college students based on financial need. Your grade determines the amount you qualify for. However, your parents’ income determines whether or not you are considered for the loan. Subsidized loans do not have interest while the student is in school; the interest begins accruing once the student graduates.</p> 
<p>Direct unsubsidized loans: loans that are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. Financial need does not dictate who these loans are available to. Interest accumulates over time.</p>
<p>Direct PLUS loans - loans that are available to graduate students and parents of dependent undergraduate students; these loans cover the costs that financial aid does not cover. If a student were in need of more money even after direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans, they could apply for a direct PLUS loan.</p>
<p>Direct consolidation loans: lets one combine several federal student loans with a loan servicer and interest rate. These loans increase the repayment term and lower the monthly bill, but they can increase the amount of interest paid. </p>
