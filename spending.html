<p class = "question" > <b>Tips on Spending:</b></p>
<p>Focus on needs vs. wants. Prioritize spending on necessary expenses such as rent, food, utilities, and transportation, before indulging in luxury expenses.</p>
<p>1. Follow the 50/20/30 rule! Divide your income into three categories, spending 50% on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings.</p>
<p>2. Avoid impulse purchases. Plan for spending by creating shopping lists, price comparisons, and avoiding impulse buying.</p>
<p>3. Use credit cards responsibly. Keep track of your spending, pay your balance in full, and avoid accumulating high-interest credit card debt.</p>
<p>4. Consider long-term impacts. When considering a purchase, ask yourself if it aligns with your long-term financial goals, such as saving for a down payment on a house or retirement.</p>

<p class = "question" > <b>What is credit?</b></p>
<p>Credit is the ability to borrow money, and pay it back later, usually with interest.</p>
<p>That’s how a credit card works! It’s essentially a loan where you are borrowing money from the card issuer. You can then pay back the amount you borrowed (plus interest) over time. If you do not pay the full balance each month, you will be charged interest on the remaining balance. It is important to use credit cards responsibly and to only borrow what you can afford to pay back, in order to avoid accumulating debt and damaging your credit score.</p>
